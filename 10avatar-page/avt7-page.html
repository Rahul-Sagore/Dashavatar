ideal character of Indian people.He is Vishnu descended upon
earth to conquer all the Indian peninsula, included Sri Lanka,
under the Bharata rule. Lord Rama is one of the most adored 
gods in India. He is always holding a bow and arrow indicating his
readiness to destroy evils. His story forms the epic Ramayana. He is
perfect in every aspect; the perfect man, the perfect husband, the
perfect brother, the perfect king, etc. and the obedient son.
