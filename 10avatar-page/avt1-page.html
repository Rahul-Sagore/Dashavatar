<pre><h1>Matsya-the fish</h1>
<img src="images/avt1.1.jpg" align="left"><p>In the earliest yuga (era) of Sata-yuga, a king named Manu was
performing severe penance for thousands of years. One day as he
was performing ablutions with river water, a small fish came into
his hands and just as he was about to throw the fish back into the
river, the fish requested the king to save its life. Heeding its request,
the king put the fish into a jar of water but the fish started growing
and the jar was not big enough for it. Then the king threw it into
the river, but it soon it outgrew the river and the king then threw
it into Ganges and then into the ocean. The king realised that it
was Lord Vishnu himself and then the lord made an appearance and made a 
special request to the king. It predicted that the world would come to an end
by a huge flood in seven days and requested the king to build a huge boat and
take the seven sages(hermits), seeds of all plants, one animal of each type and
told him that he would appear as a fish to propel the boat to Mount Himavan
for surviving the flood to the next yuga(eon). True to his word, after seven days
the Lord appeared and the king tied the boat to the fish by using the royal serpent
Vasuki and the fish took all of them to Mt Himavan and kept them there till the
flood was over and in the new era, the king started procreation a for the new era.<p>
