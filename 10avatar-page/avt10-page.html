<pre><h1>Kalki is believed as the next Avatar of Vishnu.</h1>
<p>It is believed that He will appear, riding his white horse and drawing a
flaming sword, at the end of the Kali Yuga, the dark age through which
we are now passing. His task will be to exterminate the evil and restore 
the Dharma. Thus will begin a new cycle, starting with the new Satya Yuga.
