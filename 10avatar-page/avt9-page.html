<pre><h1>Buddha</h1>
<img src="images/avt9.jpg" width="350" height="300" align="left">
<p>With the departure of Lord Krishna (Krishna Avatar), the Kali
yuga set in. In this age, the true devotion to Vedas was replaced
by empty rituals. To enlighten the world, Lord Vishnu descended
the earth as Buddha, the enlightened one.
He was born as the crown prince of the Kapilavastu to King 
Suddhodana and Maya. He was named Siddhartha, meaning "All
thing fulfilled". But his mother died soon after his birth and was
broughtup by Prajapati, the sister of Maya. Buddha was saddened
by death of living creatures, and vices like poverty. He wasn't happy
with any answers that were provided to him and he decided to find
out the meaning and the absolute truth and he left his wife and
child to a hermit's life in the forest and became the enlightened one.
His preachings spawned off the religion of Buddhism now popular
across the whole world. Buddha advocated the Middle Path, in whice
he offered a balanced, harmonious way of life, steering between two
extremes of self-indulgence and total abstinence. Buddhism rests upon
four Noble Truths:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>  <h2>Suffering is universal,</h2>
<li>  <h2>It is caused by desire and yearning</h2>
<li>  <h2>Suffering can be prevented and overcome and</h2>
<li>  <h2>Eradication of desires can lead to removal of suffering.</h2>
<p>To prevent suffering one has to conquer craving and desire and this
conquest leads to the attainment of nirvana or complete enlightenment.
