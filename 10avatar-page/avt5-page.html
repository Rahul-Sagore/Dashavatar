<p>BALI, the grandson of Prahlada was a very valorous and mighty asura. By his
penance and might, he conquered the whole world. Indra and other gods fearing
that he and the asuras would conquer all the three worlds, went to Lord Vishnu for
help. Lord Vishnu was then born as a dwarf Vamana in the household of a brahman
priest. He went to Bali on growing up and asked for alms. Bali was delighted to offer
him anything he requested even though his royal guru warned him that it was Lord
Vishnu. Vamana then requested for the amount of land that could come under his
three feet. Bali gracefully agreed. Lord Vishnu then grew in size and covered the earth
and heaven in two stride. And due to lack of space, he put his third leg on Bali himself
and crushed Bali to the nether or the Patala loka (underground world), thus helping
the Gods out.</p></pre>
